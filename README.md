# Histogram-Analysis
Anomaly detection in vibration signal


This project was used to detect signal anomalyies according to DAQ Ni9074. 
The histogram design is used by mathmatical estatistics to evaluate the gaussian distribution so we can see if there was a difference 
between the initial second of signal, and the second before.
